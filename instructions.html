        <p>Halo: Combat Evolved was one of the classic games of the early 2000s. It began one of the most successful and beloved game franchises ever. The thing people really love about Halo is the responsive, satisfying, gameplay. You could put hours into this game and still be finding more new things to try and experience.

            Halo has two main gameplay options, the campaign where you will get to fight through computer controlled enemies in the several levels that the campaign has to offer while learning about the story of Halo through cutscenes and character dialogue. The other is the player vs player game modes. Halo has a multitude of different game modes to choose from each with different objectives or unique maps. Each game mode will allow you to play against other real people in team or solo game mode.
