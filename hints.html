        <h1>HINTS</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Aim for the head! Much like other shooter games, hitting enemies and players alike in the head will do immense damage

            Grunts are weak, but be wary of the ones with fuel rod guns, they can be incredibly dangerous if ignored. But don’t worry! Getting close to them will stop them from shooting (to avoid blowing themselves up as well).
            
            Elites overall aren’t too bad, but watch out for the golden ones. They have energy swords and will plow through you with it like butter, however, they lack a ranged weapon. So remember to take care of them at a distance before they reach you!
            
            Hunters look big and scary at first, but once you understand them they become a real pushover. Their entire body is invulnerable except two orange spots on their back and head. Don’t waste ammo on their armored parts. Get some hits in the weak spots and Boom! The big scary alien dies.
            
            If you’re having trouble shooting around Jackal shields, use your plasma infantry, it’s the only stuff that can destroy their shields. If you don’t want to waste your precious plasma bullets, do your best to get around them. Oh! And don’t let them charge up their pistols. They get rid of your shields right away.
