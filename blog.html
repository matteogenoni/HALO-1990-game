        <p>Halo: Combat Evolved will always be treasured as one of the most incredible and 
            innovative shooters of all time. Starting what would blossom into an iconic franchise. 
            A spark of color in a wasteland of bland and simple First Person Shooters, and Halo is 
            able to accomplish this by just being fun. It’s really hard to explain, but almost every 
            aspect of Halo is designed to be fun and exciting. The enemy AI in the campaign is fascinating. 
            Weaker enemies will scatter when stronger enemies are taken out, which adds an entire new layer 
            of strategy to a very simple concept and makes it feel like you’re fighting off REAL forces 
            and not just a bunch of faceless, mindless, bullet sponges. Though the campaign has its strengths, 
            it’s the multiplayer that really gets the most praise. Every player has an incredibly wide arsenal 
            of gadgets and weapons that only complement the combat against others. The game also came with a 
            variety of different modes, like capture the flag, oddball, slayer, king of the hill, and race. 
            The only downside to always having this wide variety of modes available is that some modes were 
            much less popular than others, meaning that if you wanted to play the mode that wasn’t currently 
            the most popular, you’d most likely be waiting a long time for the lobby to fill. But something 
            that’s really great, is that over time as the game amassed its cult following, modders in the community 
            began sharing their own unique modes with others. A true cultural behemoth that left its mark and stayed.
